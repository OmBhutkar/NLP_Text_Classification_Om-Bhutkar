# NLP_Text_Classification

# **Text Classification Using Machine Learning**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **text classification** using **Logistic Regression** and **Na√Øve Bayes**. The dataset is preprocessed, transformed using **TF-IDF vectorization**, and evaluated using multiple performance metrics.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains textual data with corresponding labels. It is divided into:  
- **training.csv** (80% of data)  
- **test.csv** (20% of data)  

Each record consists of:  
- `text`: The input text  
- `label`: The category/class assigned to the text  

---

## **Preprocessing**  
Before training, the text data undergoes preprocessing:  
‚úî Convert text to lowercase  
‚úî Tokenization using **NLTK**  
‚úî Stopword removal using **NLTK**  
‚úî Stemming using **PorterStemmer**  
‚úî Lemmatization using **WordNetLemmatizer**  
‚úî Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**

## **Model Training**  
Two models were trained and evaluated:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Logistic Regression**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Na√Øve Bayes (MultinomialNB)**  

Both models were trained on the processed dataset using **scikit-learn**.  

---

## **Evaluation**  
The models were evaluated using:  
- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1-score**  
- **Confusion Matrix** (Visualized using Seaborn)  

---

## **Results**  

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|------------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | **87.15%**  | High       | High   | High     |
| Na√Øve Bayes        | **76.55%**  | Moderate   | Moderate | Moderate  |

‚úî **Logistic Regression outperformed Na√Øve Bayes**, achieving higher accuracy and better classification results.  

üìä Confusion matrices were plotted using **Seaborn heatmaps** to analyze misclassifications.

## **Installation**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmBhutkar/text-classification.git
cd text-classification
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script**  
```bash
python train_model.py
```

## **Usage**
